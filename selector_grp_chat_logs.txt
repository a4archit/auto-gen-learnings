[FunctionExecutionResult(content='["SpaceX CEO Elon Musk plans to launch Starship to Mars by 2026, carrying Tesla\'s Optimus robot. Human missions could follow by 2029, although", "# SpaceX Explosion Blasts Mars Timeline: 2026 Goal Likely Delayed. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched a mandatory investigation following the explosion, stating that “a return to flight is contingent on the FAA determining that any systems, processes, or procedures related to the mishap do not compromise public safety.” This regulatory intervention will likely extend SpaceX\'s already-compressed development timeline. In September 2024, SpaceX publicly criticized the FAA over regulatory delays that pushed back a planned Starship launch by approximately two months, with Musk stating, “We will never get humanity to Mars if this continues.”. SpaceX has yet to publicly detail comprehensive solutions for spacecraft life-support systems, radiation protection during the months-long journey, and the resource utilization technologies necessary for sustaining human presence on Mars. In 2016, Musk predicted people would reach Mars by 2025, and by 2020, he adjusted his projection stating SpaceX was on track for an unmanned mission by 2024.", \'2033 is realistic for a crewed mission, but depending on the Mars infrastructure for refueling the return trip it could easily slip. 2035 gives\', \'Despite hutting hurdles, SpaceX believes the Starship is on track as far as the Mars mission is concerned but timelines remain uncertain…\', \'Plans then call for steadily increasing the number of flights every 26 months, in each subsequent launch opportunity: 100 Starships in 2031, 500 in 2033, working up to the eventual target of “1,000 or 2,000 ships per Mars rendezvous,” Musk said, with each crewed Starship carrying 100 to 200 passengers. For the inaugural Starship launches to Mars, the spacecraft will carry Optimus robots, like those shown in this illustration, to set up the infrastructure required for human astronauts to survive on the surface. Given Starship’s touted 100-metric-ton payload capacity, Zubrin believes that SpaceX could deliver an army of rovers and rotorcraft, “like the troops coming off the landing craft at Normandy Beach,” he says, and conduct more Mars science in two years than NASA has been able to in decades. “A lot of people take it as a given that it will work, and there’s really no guarantee,” says Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, about SpaceX, Starship and Mars.\']', name='get_news_headlines', call_id='call_3vM2AjUSglw2tu27kyseRJNe', is_error=False)]
